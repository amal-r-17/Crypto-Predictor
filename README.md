## LSTM based model to prdict rise and fall of crypto price
Here I have created an LSTM based Deep learning model that predicts if the price of a cryptocurrency will rise or fall depending on the previous sequential data. 
- The python notebook provided with this repository, explains in detail what is happening.
- Data : [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gqd1It7miG_lrSbUrWfoEop9hKlV9tQ9/view?usp=sharing)
- In this, the previous 60 minutes of data(stock prices and volume moved) are used to predict 3 minutes into the future if the price will go up or down.
